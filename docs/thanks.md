## Special Thanks

This library stands on the shoulders of some incredible developers. A special thanks to:

__&#8226; @tautologistics's node-htmlparser:__
This HTML parser can parse anything! The parser produces really consistent results, even when the HTML string has errors. This man is a genius.
 
__&#8226; @harryf's node-soupselect:__ 
What an incredibly fast and precise CSS selector engine. Never really liked the feature-rich selector engines â€“ this engine strikes a great balance.

__&#8226; @jQuery team:__
The core API is the best of it's class and despite dealing with all the browser inconsistencies the code base is extremely clean and easy to follow. Much of cheerio's implementation and documentation is from jQuery. Thanks guys.

The style, the structure, the open-source"-ness" of this library comes from studying TJ's style and using many of his libraries. This dude consistently pumps out high-quality libraries and has always been more than willing to help or answer questions. You rock TJ.
